//In the torn apart area of grape country, the two factions; The Cabernet (reds) and The Grape Seeds(greens) are fighting each other. 
//The Cabernet seek to steal grapes and destroy the farms of the Grape Seeds. The Grape Seeds are making their grapes into medicine.
//The sheriff, Geoffrey the Kid from the Grape Drank (purple) faction seeks to stop The Cabernet. His first stop leads him to a 
//member of The Cabernet who fires at him. Geoffrey is quick to end him, and he continues his search for The Cabernet leader, 
//John Hiccup Adams. The Kid is stopped by a wall with an enemy on top. The Kid dispatches him and looks for a way to clear the wall.
//Geoffrey sees a box of TNT on the top of the wall, he fires and instantly an explosion destroyed the majority of the wall. 
//Geoffrey continues to get to the saloon. At the front of the saloon are two reds, Geoffrey takes cover and wins the unfavourable 
//fight.just as The Kid leaves the cover, Adams slides under the saloon door. Geoffrey prepares to duel against Adams, but when The Kid
//enters he is hauled by a rocket powered piano and a red standing on top of it. The Kid shoots the red standing on top but as he 
//shoots the piano, the bullet does nothing. The Kid quickly learns to jump on top of the piano and escapes the saloon. As The Kid 
//lands he sees the back of his enemy. A breeze kicks in and Adams turns around, and faces the man who he is about to duel. "You're 
//making a mistake The Kid", Adams pleads. Adams explains " The Grape Seeds are using you, join me and stop them". The Kid doesn't
//believe his story, " Fine!" Adams yells and then shoots at The Kid. They duel, The Kid is out gunned but not out skilled. The Kid 
//wins the duel, and with Adams' final words he says " you f..foo.ol..fool". The leader of The Grape Seeds appears out of nowhere, 
//with a evil laugh he says " You have fallen for my plans, and now i have won". The Kid is filled with shock and horror, as The 
//Grape Seed explains more. The Grape Seeds have been lying to all the people in Grape Country, saying their grapes can be medicine 
//when they're just normal grapes. The Grape Seeds have been making profits off the misfortune and illnesses of others. The Cabernet
//were attempting to stop their evil deeds, while their wine profits got to rebuilding the torn apart area of Grape Country. 
//suddently The Kid is shot and blacks out. The Kid finds himself in a saloon, where he is given the best Grape Drank brand Grape 
//Drank he has ever had. Geoffrey sees beautiful colours everywhere, until the leader of The Grape Seeds knocks the drink out of his 
//hands. The Kid pulls out his gun and is about to shoot the Leader, but then he wakes up. The Kid is still on the ground where he 
//was shot. He over hears the leader talking to a henchmen about how they have been putting funds into the Lazarous Device, a 
//machine that allows you to live forever and is fulled by uranium . The henchment is warning the leader that the machine wasn't 
//sealed properly when he went into it. The Kid gets up and tries to shoot the leader, but the leader starts freaking out and his 
//body starts changing. The leader is now a dragon. As The Kid fends off the dragon, the henchmen runs away. The Kid's bullets will
//are not harming the dragon. The dragon lets out a giant ball of fire and The Kid gets the idea to shoot his mouth. The dragon 
//flinches in pain. The Kid now has the means to end this fight. After the last hit is strung, the leader turns back to normal and 
//with his last words he says " you pooppy head, i'm telling mum".
